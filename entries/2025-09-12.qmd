  p1: 'Think of a media-related issue or question you find interesting (e.g., misinformation on social media, representation in film, streaming habits). Now imagine researching that issue without using any theory—just collecting facts. What would be missing from your findings? Reflect on how theory might deepen or improve your ability to explain or understand the issue. What questions might theory help you ask?'
  p2: 'After reading about the social scientific, interpretive, and critical/cultural paradigms, which approach feels most aligned with how you think about research, or how you want to think about it? Why? Share a media topic you care about and describe how your chosen paradigm would shape your research questions, methods, and the kind of insights you might produce.'
  p3: 'Pick one communication theory mentioned in this chapter (e.g., Cultivation Theory, Social Comparison Theory, Feminist Theory). Briefly describe how this theory interprets a real-world communication problem (e.g., violence in media, body image, online harassment). Then reflect on how your understanding of the issue changes when seen through that theoretical lens. What does the theory help you notice that you might not have otherwise?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
The paradigm that aligns most with how I think about research is the interpretive paradigm. I am interested in this approach because it focuses on understanding people’s experiences and perspectives instead of just measuring them with numbers or making predictions. Research, to me, is about understanding how individuals interpret their lives, the symbols they use, and the cultural contexts that shape those meanings. I think part of why I align most with this paradigm is because my minor is in anthropology. Anthropology has taught me to value culture, context, and personal/lived experience, which connects to interpretive research. It may be because I really enjoy the subject itself, or because I have been taught to think with this mindset, but either way anthropology has changed how I see the world, approach research, and analyze situations. A media topic I care about right now is how TikTok users post reaction photos in the comment section to express feelings rather than only using words. If I look at this through the interpretive paradigm, my research questions would focus on how meaning or feelings are created. How do users interpret and understand the use of reaction photos? What shared cultural references, jokes, or memes make these images make sense? How do visual reactions build community or belonging between users? To answer these questions, I would use qualitative methods like observing TikTok communities and comment sections online, looking at how people use reaction photos in comments, and interviewing active TikTok users about their experiences and why they chose certain images. These approaches would allow me to explore the symbolic and cultural aspects of this unique visual communication, showing how images function as a way to share complex emotions. The results would reveal how TikTok comment sections work as spaces where people determine meaning, share humor, and form community through nonverbal expression.
