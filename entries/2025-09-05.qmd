  p2: 'Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them.'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
When researching public social media platforms, I would consider the content to be public since it is accessible without restrictions. These social media platforms are made for sharing content, and users know their posts can be seen by anyone online. Therefore, researchers often treat public posts as a data source that does not require consent. However, there are ethical gray areas. Publicly available does not always mean users expect or give permission for their content to be studied. People posting TikTok videos would probably assume their audience is other users on the app, not academic researchers. Reddit users are usually anonymous, but their posts are still linked to a username. Tweets can also be linked to identities, even if the person did not intend for them to be analyzed. Due to these gray areas it is important to consider privacy, consent, and harm. The best practices to use would be paraphrasing instead of quoting posts directly, removing identifying information, and thinking carefully about the effect of the content on the original poster. Even if consent is not legally or technically required, from an ethical standpoint it may be the better  or safer choice in studies involving sensitive topics. I would follow the principle of “do no harm” and ask myself if this research could expose, embarrass, or endanger the person that posted it. If so, I would make the data or source anonymous or possibly aid in additional protections for the poster. Public content can absolutely be used in research, but ethical responsibility means treating online users as real people and not just data.
