2,1,"""Think about a claim you’ve seen online that you weren’t sure was true. How would the principles of empiricism and control help you design a study to test whether it was accurate?"""
2,2,"""Choose a topic you’re curious about in media or communication (e.g., the effect of streaming on movie watching, how politicians use TikTok, portrayals of families on TV). Write a specific research question about it. Then, briefly describe what you would do in each of the five stages of the research workflow (Conceptualization, Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Communication) to answer it."""
2,3,"""Describe a time you learned a digital tool (in any context—school, work, a hobby) without really understanding the reasoning behind what you were doing. How might knowing the ""why""—the tool-agnostic principles—have helped you use it more effectively, solve problems, or even choose a better tool for the task?"""
3,1,"""Choose either the Nazi medical experiments or the Tuskegee syphilis study and reflect on what that case teaches us about the need for ethical safeguards in research. Why do you think these events had such a lasting impact on how research is conducted today? How might studying these cases shape your behavior as a future researcher?"""
3,2,"""Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them."""
3,3,"""Think ahead to a study you might conduct as part of this course. What would it look like to fully honor the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in your research? Identify at least one concrete action you would take during your study’s design or data collection to uphold each of these three ethical principles."""
4,1,"""Think of a media-related issue or question you find interesting (e.g., misinformation on social media, representation in film, streaming habits). Now imagine researching that issue without using any theory—just collecting facts. What would be missing from your findings? Reflect on how theory might deepen or improve your ability to explain or understand the issue. What questions might theory help you ask?"""
4,2,"""After reading about the social scientific, interpretive, and critical/cultural paradigms, which approach feels most aligned with how you think about research, or how you want to think about it? Why? Share a media topic you care about and describe how your chosen paradigm would shape your research questions, methods, and the kind of insights you might produce."""
4,3,"""Pick one communication theory mentioned in this chapter (e.g., Cultivation Theory, Social Comparison Theory, Feminist Theory). Briefly describe how this theory interprets a real-world communication problem (e.g., violence in media, body image, online harassment). Then reflect on how your understanding of the issue changes when seen through that theoretical lens. What does the theory help you notice that you might not have otherwise?"""
5,1,"""Reflect on the metaphor introduced at the beginning of the chapter: walking into a conversation that’s already underway. Have you ever had that experience in real life (in class, online, or at work)? What happened when you did—or didn’t—take the time to listen first? How does that scenario relate to the role of the literature review in research? Why is it important to understand what’s already been said before adding your ideas?"""
5,2,"""Think about a media-related topic that interests you (e.g., influencer culture, video game violence, media portrayals of mental health). Now imagine you are preparing to write a literature review on that topic. What kind of “gap” would you look for to justify a new study? Would it be a topical void, a contradiction, or an overlooked perspective? Why does that kind of gap matter in media research?"""
5,3,"""In your own words, explain the difference between an annotated bibliography and a proper literature review. Why is that difference significant? Reflect on a time when you had to summarize multiple sources for a paper or project. Did you organize those sources thematically, or treat each one individually? Looking ahead, how will your approach change when writing your literature review?"""
6,1,"""Think of a broad media-related topic you’ve been curious about—something like influencer culture, algorithmic feeds, or news bias. Now, imagine you’re preparing to research this topic. Would you start with a research question or a hypothesis? Why? Reflect on how much you already know (or don’t know) about the topic, and how that affects whether exploration or prediction is the better fit."""
6,2,"""This chapter outlines five criteria for strong research questions and hypotheses: clarity, grounding in literature, researchability, clear identification of variables or phenomena, and significance. Choose one of these criteria and explain why it seems especially important to you as a beginner researcher. Then, critique a question or hypothesis (real or imagined) that fails to meet this criterion. What makes it fall short?"""
6,3,"""The chapter emphasized that your research question or hypothesis should directly shape the method you choose. Why do you think that connection is so important? Choose one method (e.g., experiment, interview, content analysis) and describe what kind of research question or hypothesis best fits that method. Use your own topic or one discussed in the chapter as an example."""
7,1,"""The chapter opens with the story of John Snow and the Broad Street pump—an example of how sampling can reveal powerful truths about a whole system. Reflect on a time you formed a strong opinion or insight based on a small piece of evidence (e.g., a social media post, a conversation, a single article). Was that sample representative of the broader reality? What does this example teach you about the risks or rewards of inference from a small sample?"""
7,2,"""Imagine you are planning a study on how college students interact with AI tools like ChatGPT. Would you choose a probability sampling method or a non-probability one? Why? Consider your research goals—do you want to generalize to all college students or understand a specific group more deeply? Explain your choice and what trade-offs it involves in terms of access, time, cost, and generalizability."""
7,3,"""Much of today’s research relies on digital data—tweets, posts, videos, and online surveys. This chapter explains how population bias, self-selection bias, and data availability bias can distort digital research. Choose one of these forms of bias and describe how it might affect a study of online news consumption or streaming habits. What could a researcher do to acknowledge or reduce that bias?"""
8,1,"""Choose an abstract concept that matters to you—something like identity, motivation, fandom, or stress. Now, imagine you’re going to study it for a research project. How would you go about clarifying its meaning? What dimensions or components would you want to include? Reflect on how difficult it is to turn a concept you feel into something you can study. What does this reveal about the importance of conceptualization?"""
8,2,"""Select one of the following concepts: political engagement, body image, media literacy, or interpersonal trust. First, write a short conceptual definition for the term in your own words. Then, brainstorm 2–3 specific ways a researcher might operationalize that concept. What kinds of survey questions, observational criteria, or behavioral measures might capture it? How do your choices shape what “counts” as evidence?"""
8,3,"""Think about a time you were measured or evaluated—maybe on a test, a performance review, or even a personality quiz. Did the measure feel reliable (consistent)? Did it feel valid (accurate)? Explain your experience and how it relates to the difference between reliability and validity. Why is it essential for a measure to be both? Which one seems more complicated to achieve, and why?"""
9,1,"""Think about a time when you were asked to take a survey—maybe in a class, at work, or online. Did any of the questions confuse you, feel biased, or leave you without an option that reflected your honest opinion? Describe one such moment. What made the question problematic, and how might you rewrite it to improve it?"""
9,2,"""Imagine you're designing a survey for your research project. What would be the central question your survey aims to answer? List two variables you’d want to measure and describe one closed-ended and one open-ended question you would include to help you do so. Why did you choose each format?"""
9,3,"""Why do you think people often ignore or skip surveys? From your perspective as both a respondent and future researcher, what strategies would make you more likely to complete a survey? How do your answers shape the way researchers must think about sampling and nonresponse?"""
10,1,"""Think of a headline or news story you’ve seen that claims one thing causes another (e.g., ""Teens who use social media are more likely to be depressed""). Based on what you've learned in this chapter, explain why this claim may or may not be valid. What type of research design would be necessary to make such a claim confidently?"""
10,2,"""Choose a communication-related research question you’re interested in (e.g., “Does political meme exposure influence voting confidence?”). Then briefly describe how you might set up a simple experiment to test that question. What would you manipulate? What would you measure? How would random assignment help strengthen your conclusions?"""
10,3,"""Experiments often require researchers to deceive participants or control aspects of their environment. Reflect on how you feel about that. Do you think the benefits of experimental knowledge are worth these trade-offs? What would be essential to include in your debrief if you had to deceive participants in your study?"""
11,1,"""Think about a media environment you engage with regularly—TikTok, news headlines, TV dramas, YouTube comments, etc. Choose one and describe a research question that could be answered through content analysis. What would you want to measure? Would you be more interested in manifest content (what’s there) or latent content (the underlying tone or message), and why?"""
11,2,"""Manual coding offers nuance; automated coding provides scale. Reflect on a situation where you believe a manual approach would be necessary despite being more time-consuming. Then, describe another situation where automation would be the better choice. What do your examples reveal about the limits and strengths of each?"""
11,3,"""When researchers assign meaning to words or visuals, especially in latent coding or sentiment analysis, they make interpretive choices. What risks might arise from misclassifying tone, intent, or topic? Why is coder training—or model training—so essential to ensure fairness, especially when analyzing issues involving identity, politics, or public opinion?"""
12,1,"""Have you ever worked with a spreadsheet, dataset, or even a shared document that felt chaotic or disorganized? Describe the experience. What kinds of ""messiness"" did you encounter? Looking back, which data wrangling principles from this chapter would have helped clean it up?"""
12,2,"""Imagine you're analyzing survey data and discover that some responses are missing or strangely formatted. You realize you could remove them, impute values, or rewrite categories to make things ""fit."" What would guide your decision-making in that situation? How does data cleaning impact the honesty and transparency of research?"""
12,3,"""The chapter argues that wrangling is not just technical work—it’s interpretive. Think about a time you had to make a judgment call while organizing information (e.g., editing a document, categorizing files, formatting content). How might similar interpretive choices show up in data wrangling? How does this shape the final story your data tells?"""
13,1,"""Think about a variable you’ve seen reported often—something like income, grades, or social media followers. Was it reported as an average (mean)? Do you think that number accurately reflected the “typical” case? Based on what you learned in this chapter, would another measure of central tendency (median or mode) have been more appropriate? Why?"""
13,2,"""Describe a time when a graph or chart helped you understand something better than a list of numbers could. What did the visual help reveal? Based on this chapter, which principle of good visualization do you think was at work? If you’ve seen a bad graph or misleading chart, describe that too—and explain what could have made it clearer."""
13,3,"""The chapter describes descriptive analysis as a “first conversation” with your data. Why is it essential to fully describe your sample before jumping to conclusions or testing hypotheses? How might skipping this step lead to bad research or misleading claims?"""
14,1,"""This chapter describes inference as a “leap” from sample to population. Reflect on what makes that leap trustworthy—or risky. Why is it not enough to observe a pattern in your sample? How does hypothesis testing help, and what limits remain even when your results are statistically significant?"""
14,2,"""Many people misunderstand the p-value as “proof.” Why is this incorrect? What does a small p-value tell us—and what does it not tell us? Reflect on a time you saw a research claim or news headline that leaned too heavily on the idea of “significance.” What might have been missing?"""
14,3,"""Imagine you find a statistically significant result in your research—but the effect size is tiny. Would you still report it? Why or why not? How do you balance statistical significance with practical or social importance? What responsibility do researchers have when communicating findings that might be misinterpreted?"""
