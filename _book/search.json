    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nThe paradigm that aligns most with how I think about research is the interpretive paradigm. I am interested in this approach because it focuses on understanding people’s experiences and perspectives instead of just measuring them with numbers or making predictions. Research, to me, is about understanding how individuals interpret their lives, the symbols they use, and the cultural contexts that shape those meanings. I think part of why I align most with this paradigm is because my minor is in anthropology. Anthropology has taught me to value culture, context, and personal/lived experience, which connects to interpretive research. It may be because I really enjoy the subject itself, or because I have been taught to think with this mindset, but either way anthropology has changed how I see the world, approach research, and analyze situations. A media topic I care about right now is how TikTok users post reaction photos in the comment section to express feelings rather than only using words. If I look at this through the interpretive paradigm, my research questions would focus on how meaning or feelings are created. How do users interpret and understand the use of reaction photos? What shared cultural references, jokes, or memes make these images make sense? How do visual reactions build community or belonging between users? To answer these questions, I would use qualitative methods like observing TikTok communities and comment sections online, looking at how people use reaction photos in comments, and interviewing active TikTok users about their experiences and why they chose certain images. These approaches would allow me to explore the symbolic and cultural aspects of this unique visual communication, showing how images function as a way to share complex emotions. The results would reveal how TikTok comment sections work as spaces where people determine meaning, share humor, and form community through nonverbal expression.",

The principle of empiricism would help me to test this claim by turning it into something observable and measurable. I would start by defining the variables: the type of glasses (blue light blocking versus clear placebo), the amount or frequency of headaches, and the intensity or pain level (using a standardized 1–10 scale) of those headaches. The measurable data would be the number of headaches and average pain/intensity over a set time period. Collecting this type of data makes the claim concrete and testable instead of relying on personal stories or the marketing of the company. The principle of control would ensure that other factors do not interfere with the results of the study. For example, I would randomly assign participants the real blue light blocking glasses or the placebo clear glasses and require everyone to wear them for the same amount of time each day, especially during screen use. By making sure the conditions are constant, I could focus on the effect of the glasses themselves. If the participants wearing blue light blocking glasses reported fewer or less painful headaches than those wearing placebo glasses, the evidence would support the claim. If no difference was found, it would debunk the idea that the glasses help prevent headaches and other factors like screen time, stress, or posture might be the real cause of the headaches.",

These social media platforms are made for sharing content, and users know their posts can be seen by anyone online. Therefore, researchers often treat public posts as a data source that does not require consent. However, there are ethical gray areas. Publicly available does not always mean users expect or give permission for their content to be studied. People posting TikTok videos would probably assume their audience is other users on the app, not academic researchers. Reddit users are usually anonymous, but their posts are still linked to a username. Tweets can also be linked to identities, even if the person did not intend for them to be analyzed. Due to these gray areas it is important to consider privacy, consent, and harm. The best practices to use would be paraphrasing instead of quoting posts directly, removing identifying information, and thinking carefully about the effect of the content on the original poster. Even if consent is not legally or technically required, from an ethical standpoint it may be the better or safer choice in studies involving sensitive topics. I would follow the principle of “do no harm” and ask myself if this research could expose, embarrass, or endanger the person that posted it. If so, I would make the data or source anonymous or possibly aid in additional protections for the poster. Public content can absolutely be used in research, but ethical responsibility means treating online users as real people and not just data.",

A lot of research already looks at how these groups are shown on screen, pointing out problems like stereotypes, token characters, or the lack of meaningful roles. However, research is missing how women and minority audiences themselves feel about these portrayals. In other words, we know a lot about what is being shown, but not enough about how people who belong to these groups actually internalize or respond to it. Representation is not just about what appears in a movie, it is also about how it is received. For example, a film that critics might praise as diverse or empowering could still feel fake, shallow, or offensive to some viewers. On the other hand, a movie that seems stereotypical on the surface might still be meaningful or relatable to certain audiences. If studies do not include these audience perspectives, they risk assuming the effects of representation instead of understanding them. By paying attention to this overlooked perspective, researchers could better connect on screen portrayals to real life experiences, identity, and feelings of belonging. It would also give more space for women and minority voices, who have often been left out of both movies and academic research. Filling this gap makes media studies stronger, because it looks at the whole picture, not just how women and minorities are portrayed, but how they see those portrayals and how it impacts their lives.",

My opinion was based on one small piece of evidence: I do not like eating, or the taste of raw fish. From that, I decided that sushi places weren’t for me and I don’t like them. For years, I refused to go. I assumed my dislike of raw fish meant I would dislike the entire dining experience. In hindsight, I realize I had taken a very limited sample, my feelings about raw fish, and generalized it to decide an opinion on an entire type of cuisine. Eventually, I gave in and went to Wasabi with friends, and to my surprise, I discovered a variety of dishes I actually enjoyed. Many sushi restaurants offer a range of appetizers, soups, and cooked items that I had never considered. I found that I liked options such as miso soup, chicken katsu, gyoza, and California rolls, which do not contain raw fish. That single experience changed my mind and now I really enjoy going to Wasabi and enjoy the food I order. What I had treated as a representative “sample” of sushi restaurants was really just my personal bias against one food. This experience taught me about the risks of drawing conclusions from small or unrepresentative samples. It can feel efficient or easy to make decisions quickly based on limited evidence, but it also carries the danger of missing out on opportunities. At the same time, I learned that there are rewards when challenging those assumptions and testing opinions against broader evidence.",

When a question or hypothesis isn’t clear, it makes everything else harder, like choosing methods, deciding what data to collect, and even explaining the purpose of the study. If I don’t fully understand my own question, then there’s no way I can design a solid project around it. Without clarity, a project can become scattered, unfocused, and frustrating. A clear question helps to make decisions about what kind of data to collect, which methods to use, and how to understand the results. It also makes it easier to explain your work to others, which is important in both academic and professional settings. An example of a research question that lacks clarity is: “Do movies affect people?” At first glance, it sounds interesting, but it really doesn’t say much of anything and is very vague. What kind of movies are we talking about (horror, comedy, romance)? What kind of effects (emotions, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs)? Which group of people are we focusing on (adults, teens, women, men)? Since the question is so vague, there’s no direction for how to actually research it or start the study. A clearer version could be:“How does watching romantic comedies influence college students’ expectations of relationships?” This way, the variables are defined, the group is identified, and the effect is specific. This level of clarity makes the question stronger and now it is possible to design a study that can actually give meaningful results.",

I remember taking one of those zodiac-based personality quizzes that claimed to analyze my sign, Taurus. The results said I was dependable, loyal, and maybe a little stubborn, which had some truth to it. I took the quiz again later and got nearly identical results, so it felt reliable because it was consistent each time. However, I wouldn’t say it was valid in the sense of truly capturing who I am. Sure, some traits lined up, but others felt too generalized, like they could apply to almost anyone. That experience showed the difference between reliability and validity. Something can be steady and repeatable (reliable) without being truly accurate (valid). For any kind of measurement, whether it’s a test, a survey, or even a zodiac quiz, it’s important to have both. If something isn’t consistent, it can’t be trusted. However, if it’s consistent and still doesn’t reflect the truth, it’s not useful either. Between the two, I think validity is harder to achieve because accuracy depends on how well a test or system actually measures what it claims to. People are complex, and while zodiac signs can be entertaining and sometimes surprisingly fitting, they can’t really capture everything that makes someone who they are.",

    "text": "9.2 Response\n\nPeople often ignore or skip surveys for several reasons. Many surveys seem too long or boring so people don’t want to spend their time on them. Some think their answers won’t make a difference, or they worry about how their personal information will be used. With so many surveys and online popups for opinions, it is easy for people to just ignore them. Trust and relevance matter a lot. If a survey seems suspicious or unrelated to someone’s life, they are less likely to participate. Sometimes, even small annoyances, like poor wording or unclear instructions, can make people stop before finishing the survey. Keeping it short and simple, and clearly stating how long it will take, helps people know what to expect. Explaining why the survey matters and how the results will be used makes it feel more meaningful. Personalized invitations, instead of generic mass emails, show respondents that their opinions are valued. Offering small incentives, like a gift card, raffle, or other reward, can also motivate people to participate. These points are important for researchers to consider when thinking about sampling and nonresponse. When many people skip a survey, the results may not represent the entire group accurately, which can make the findings less reliable. Researchers need to design surveys that are easy to understand, engaging, and safe for participants. By doing this, they can increase response rates and collect more accurate, trustworthy data. Overall, understanding why people skip surveys helps researchers create better surveys and ensures their results reflect the population they want to study.",

    "text": "10.2 Response\n\nI think it is acceptable to use some level of deception in experiments to an extent, but there are clear ethical boundaries that should never be crossed. In certain studies, especially in psychology, limited deception can be necessary to prevent participants from changing their behavior and to obtain more accurate data. For example, social behavior studies might require participants to be unaware of the true purpose so that their responses remain natural. In these cases, the benefits of experimental knowledge can justify minor deception, but only if the study poses no harm and receives proper ethical approval. However, scientific evidence or data is never worth extreme deception or manipulation. Researchers have an ethical duty to protect participants from emotional distress, embarrassment, or harm. Misleading participants in a way that severely damages their trust, well-being, or autonomy crosses the line, no matter how valuable the findings might seem. A powerful reminder of what happens when those boundaries are ignored is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study which I learned about in another class. In this study African American men were misled and denied treatment so researchers could observe the disease’s progression. This unethical study caused immense suffering and violated basic human rights, showing that no amount of data can justify such deception. If some deception must be used, the debrief afterwards becomes essential. A proper debrief should fully explain the true purpose of the study, describe the nature and reason for the deception, and reassure participants that their reactions were normal and expected. It should also give them the opportunity to ask questions and withdraw their answers or data if they feel uncomfortable. Most importantly, the debrief should aim to restore honesty and respect, ensuring participants leave feeling informed and valued for their participation rather than misled and manipulated.",

    "text": "11.2 Response\n\nA media environment I engage with regularly is TikTok. One research question that could be explored through content analysis is: “How do TikTok creators promote sustainability while also encouraging consumerism through product recommendations?” Many TikTok users and influencers present themselves as environmentally conscious and promote sustainable lifestyles. However, a large portion of this content still focuses on buying new products, such as “eco-friendly” clothing, reusable cups, or sustainable beauty brands. These videos often market consumption as part of being environmentally responsible, which raises questions about the relationship between sustainability and consumer culture. In this study, I would want to measure how often creators link sustainability to purchasing behavior, what kinds of products they feature, and how these products are framed. For instance, do creators imply that buying these items is essential to living sustainably, or do they genuinely encourage reducing consumption and reusing what people already have? Examining the tone, presentation, and word choice of these videos could reveal a lot about the underlying messages being shared. I would focus primarily on latent content, which looks at the deeper meanings and attitudes behind the videos. While the manifest content might simply show creators talking about “green” or “eco-friendly” products, the latent content would help uncover whether the true message supports environmental responsibility or subtly promotes overconsumption disguised as sustainability. This type of analysis could highlight an important contradiction within TikTok culture: promoting sustainability while simultaneously driving consumer trends. By studying these patterns, I could better understand how TikTok shapes public perceptions of sustainability and whether it genuinely encourages eco-friendly behaviors, or simply repackages consumerism as a new, ethical lifestyle trend.",

Several people were contributing to both files, but there wasn’t much structure or communication about how to organize our work. In the Word document, people often entered information in the wrong sections or repeated what someone else had already written. Some group members weren’t very detailed, while others wrote long paragraphs that didn’t match the rest of the document’s tone. There were also different writing styles, inconsistent fonts and headings, and no clear format for citing sources or labeling sections. The slideshow was just as messy, slides were out of order, text formatting changed from one slide to the next, and there were different color schemes and bullet styles throughout. Overall, it was difficult to tell what information was finalized and what still needed to be edited. Several data wrangling principles from the chapter would have been useful in this situation. The cleaning phase, which involves standardizing and organizing information, could have helped us maintain a consistent structure across the Word document and slides. Establishing clear formatting rules and ensuring everyone followed them would have reduced confusion and made the project look more professional. The transforming phase also relates to reorganizing data into a clear and usable format, similar to rearranging slides or reorganizing sections in the Word document so that the information flowed logically. Finally, the idea of a reproducible workflow could have helped our group document who made what changes and when, keeping the editing process transparent and easier to manage. Following these principles would have saved us time and made the final project much more cohesive.",

The dataset listed migration routes, estimated dates, and archaeological sites, but reading it as a table of coordinates and time periods felt abstract and disconnected. When the same information was displayed on a world map with arrows indicating migration paths and color-coded time periods, the patterns made more sense. The visualization showed how early humans dispersed from Africa into Europe, Asia, and eventually the Americas, revealing not just where populations moved, but when and in what sequence. I could immediately see how climate shifts, such as glacial periods, corresponded with pauses or redirections in migration. This spatial representation transformed isolated data points into an easy to understand movement and adaptation over time. Based on this chapter, the key principles of “show the data” and “choose the right chart for the job” were clearly at work. The map was the most effective way to display geographic and temporal relationships, allowing me to see patterns that would have been nonexistent in numerical data. It presented the information clearly while reducing clutter and focusing attention on the meaningful trends. On the other hand, I once saw a poor visualization that used a 3D pie chart to display the distribution of cultural groups within a region. The 3D effect distorted the proportions, making some slices appear larger than they actually were. According to the principles in this chapter, a stacked bar chart or shaded map would have conveyed the same information far more clearly, helping to make accurate comparisons without visual distortion.",
