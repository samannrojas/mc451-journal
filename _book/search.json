    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nThe paradigm that aligns most with how I think about research is the interpretive paradigm. I am interested in this approach because it focuses on understanding people’s experiences and perspectives instead of just measuring them with numbers or making predictions. Research, to me, is about understanding how individuals interpret their lives, the symbols they use, and the cultural contexts that shape those meanings. I think part of why I align most with this paradigm is because my minor is in anthropology. Anthropology has taught me to value culture, context, and personal/lived experience, which connects to interpretive research. It may be because I really enjoy the subject itself, or because I have been taught to think with this mindset, but either way anthropology has changed how I see the world, approach research, and analyze situations. A media topic I care about right now is how TikTok users post reaction photos in the comment section to express feelings rather than only using words. If I look at this through the interpretive paradigm, my research questions would focus on how meaning or feelings are created. How do users interpret and understand the use of reaction photos? What shared cultural references, jokes, or memes make these images make sense? How do visual reactions build community or belonging between users? To answer these questions, I would use qualitative methods like observing TikTok communities and comment sections online, looking at how people use reaction photos in comments, and interviewing active TikTok users about their experiences and why they chose certain images. These approaches would allow me to explore the symbolic and cultural aspects of this unique visual communication, showing how images function as a way to share complex emotions. The results would reveal how TikTok comment sections work as spaces where people determine meaning, share humor, and form community through nonverbal expression.",

    "text": "2.2 Response\n\nI have seen the claim that wearing blue light blocking glasses helps prevent headaches multiple times, but I have never known for sure if it was accurate. The principle of empiricism would help me to test this claim by turning it into something observable and measurable. I would start by defining the variables: the type of glasses (blue light blocking versus clear placebo), the amount or frequency of headaches, and the intensity or pain level (using a standardized 1–10 scale) of those headaches. The measurable data would be the number of headaches and average pain/intensity over a set time period. Collecting this type of data makes the claim concrete and testable instead of relying on personal stories or the marketing of the company. The principle of control would ensure that other factors do not interfere with the results of the study. For example, I would randomly assign participants the real blue light blocking glasses or the placebo clear glasses and require everyone to wear them for the same amount of time each day, especially during screen use. By making sure the conditions are constant, I could focus on the effect of the glasses themselves. If the participants wearing blue light blocking glasses reported fewer or less painful headaches than those wearing placebo glasses, the evidence would support the claim. If no difference was found, it would debunk the idea that the glasses help prevent headaches and other factors like screen time, stress, or posture might be the real cause of the headaches.",

    "text": "3.2 Response\n\nWhen researching public social media platforms, I would consider the content to be public since it is accessible without restrictions. These social media platforms are made for sharing content, and users know their posts can be seen by anyone online. Therefore, researchers often treat public posts as a data source that does not require consent. However, there are ethical gray areas. Publicly available does not always mean users expect or give permission for their content to be studied. People posting TikTok videos would probably assume their audience is other users on the app, not academic researchers. Reddit users are usually anonymous, but their posts are still linked to a username. Tweets can also be linked to identities, even if the person did not intend for them to be analyzed. Due to these gray areas it is important to consider privacy, consent, and harm. The best practices to use would be paraphrasing instead of quoting posts directly, removing identifying information, and thinking carefully about the effect of the content on the original poster. Even if consent is not legally or technically required, from an ethical standpoint it may be the better or safer choice in studies involving sensitive topics. I would follow the principle of “do no harm” and ask myself if this research could expose, embarrass, or endanger the person that posted it. If so, I would make the data or source anonymous or possibly aid in additional protections for the poster. Public content can absolutely be used in research, but ethical responsibility means treating online users as real people and not just data.",
